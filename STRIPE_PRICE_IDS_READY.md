# üéâ STRIPE PRICE IDs READY TO DEPLOY!

## ‚úÖ CORRECT PRICE IDs OBTAINED:

```bash
STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID=price_1RvxppGsx0aBXRniq5NKm5Qr        # Starter - $19
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRICE_ID=price_1RvxqZGsx0aBXRnigushZH3c   # Professional - $49  
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID=price_1RvxrKGsx0aBXRniLjbyekUZ     # Enterprise - $199
```

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

### 1. Update Railway Environment Variables
Go to your Railway dashboard and add/update these environment variables:

```
STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID = price_1RvxppGsx0aBXRniq5NKm5Qr
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRICE_ID = price_1RvxqZGsx0aBXRnigushZH3c  
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID = price_1RvxrKGsx0aBXRniLjbyekUZ
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
- The backend code is already pushed and ready
- Once you add the environment variables, redeploy the Railway service

### 3. Test Payments
- Your Stripe payments should now work perfectly!
- Coupon codes (like KAPIL12) will work with `allow_promotion_codes: true`
- All payments will use your real Stripe products

## üéØ THE FIX:
- ‚ùå Before: `prod_SrhEurGXrG6ZB1` (Product ID - doesn't work)
- ‚úÖ After: `price_1RvxppGsx0aBXRniq5NKm5Qr` (Price ID - works!)

**This should finally fix your 6-day payment deployment issue!** üöÄ
